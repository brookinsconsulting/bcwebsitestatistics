BC Website Statistics extension INSTALL

Installation
============

1. Getting eZ publish
   ------------------

   You can download a version of eZ publish from ez.no,
   you will find the various versions at:

   http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_4_stable_releases

   Note: You will require eZ publish 4.0.0 or higher

   Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
   
   http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/installation
   and
   http://ez.no/doc


2. Installing BC Website Statistics extension package
   ---------------------------------------------

   1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

   2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcwebsitestatistics.tar.gz

   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcwebsitestatistics.tar.zip


3. Activate BC Website Statistics extension
   -------------------------------------------

   We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   You must enable the bcwebsitestatistics extension *above*
   ezwebin design extension in order for all features to function properly.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcwebsitestatistics

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcwebsitestatistics

5.8 Install the following template operators in your primary design extension's pagelayout.tpl template

    Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchin()}' as the last element before the string '</head>'.

5.9 Install the following template operator in your primary design extension's order.tpl template

    ** This step is only required if you do not use the ezwebin design extension

    'bc_ga_urchinOrder' - This template 'order.tpl' (a modified copy of the confirmorder.tpl) is enabled by default by the bcwebsitestatistics design extension and activated by default.

    Please note the following important installation dependencies surrounding the customization of the order.tpl template

    - The bcwebsitestatistics extension provides one unique template.

    - The template 'bcwebsitestatistics/order.tpl' is based on the ezwebin (3.9.0) design extension template 'shop/confirmorder.tpl'

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been modified to (upon workflow event trigger) present the user with an 'order completed' view before presenting the user with the 'order view' / 'order receipt view'.

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been simplified to ensure it's unique and distinct from the 'order receipt view'.

    - To install the operator 'bc_ga_urchinOrder', Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchinOrder( $order )}' in your own replacement for the template order.tpl

6.0 Create Workflow
