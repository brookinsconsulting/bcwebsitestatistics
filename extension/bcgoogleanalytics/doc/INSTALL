   http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/installation
   and
   http://ez.no/doc


5. Installing BC Google Analytics extension package
   ---------------------------------------------

   1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

   2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcgoogleanalytics-1_0_1.tar.gz

   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcgoogleanalytics-1_0_1.tar.zip


6. Activate BC Google Analytics extension
   -------------------------------------------

   We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   You must enable the bcgoogleanalytics extension *above*
   ezwebin design extension in order for all features to function properly.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcgoogleanalytics

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcgoogleanalytics

    {'false'|bc_ga_urchin()}

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2.3 Install BC Google Analytics Template Operators

8.2.3.1 Install the following template operators in your primary design extension's templates.

    'bc_ga_urchin'
    
    For more details on the BC Google Analytics template operator installation steps please see the file doc/USAGE.

8.2.3.2 Install the following template operators in your primary design extension's pagelayout.tpl template

    'bc_ga_urchin'

    - bc_ga_urchin - Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchin()}' as the last element before the string '</head>'.

8.2.3.3 Install the following template operator in your primary design extension's order.tpl template

    - 'bc_ga_urchinOrder' - This template (a modified copy of the confirmorder.tpl) is enabled by default by the google analytics design extension and activated by default.

    Please note the following important installation dependencies surrounding the customization of the order.tpl template

    - The bcgoogleanalytics extension provides one unique template.

    - The template 'google/analytics/order.tpl' is based on the ezwebin (3.9.0) design extension template 'shop/confirmorder.tpl'

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been modified to (upon workflow event trigger) present the user with an 'order completed' view before presenting the user with the 'order view' / 'order receipt view'.

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been simplified to ensure it's unique and distinct from the 'order receipt view'.

    - To install the operator 'bc_ga_urchinOrder', Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchinOrder( $order )}' in your own replacement for the template order.tpl

8.2.4 Create Workflow

    A) In the eZ publish admin, go to Setup -> Workflows
       and click New Workflow Group.

    B) Name the group something like "Shop" and click OK.
       The group will be added to the workflow groups.

    C) Click on the group you have just created, and in the
       Workflows box click the "New Workflow" button.

       1) Name the workflow "Receipt".

       2) You will now see an Event select dropdown.
          1) Select "Event / BC Google Analytics - Order Statistics Submission and Order Completed View"

          2) Confirm you choice by clicking the "Add Event" button
             just to the right of the select dropdown.

       3) Enter a description "BC Google Analytics Receipt Workflow Event Template View"

       4) Click the 'Ok' to save these modifications.

       5) Clear All Cache via both the administration gui and cli script.
          Please, clear all cache completely, this the most important step most people omit.

       6) Note: Do not edit workflow setting, must remove and read to affect workflow event definitions as they are stored in a very static prone to confusion if you try to edit instead of remove and re-add.

8.2.5 Install workflow to trigger
      ---------------------------

    A) Now click on the Triggers link in the left hand menu.

       In the table "Workflow Triggers" you will see a list of available triggers.
