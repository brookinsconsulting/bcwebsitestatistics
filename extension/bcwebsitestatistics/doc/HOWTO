3. Installing BC Website Statistics

3.1 Re: Installing an eZ publish extension.

    1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
    in the root of your eZ publish installation.

    2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
    necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

    [tar.gz]:
    $ tar -zxvf bcwebsitestatistics.tar.gz

    [zip]:
    $ unzip bcwebsitestatistics.tar.zip

3.2 Re: Activating an eZ publish extension.

    We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

    You must enable the bcwebsitestatistics extension *above*
    ezwebin design extension in order for all features to function properly.

    To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
    root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
    create it. Locate (or add) the block

    [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
    ActiveExtensions[]=bcwebsitestatistics

    If you run several sites using only one distribution
    and only some of the sites should use the extension,
    make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

    E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/site.ini.append(.php)
    But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcwebsitestatistics

3.3 Re: Configuring an eZ publish extension general and extension specific settings

    If you have a custom design extension other than the stock eZ Publish ezwebin, 
    please take care to ensure your own custom design extension is prioritized above the bcwebsitestatistics extension.

4. Installing account number

    To change the required 'Urchin' setting.

    First create a global setting override or siteaccess override
    of the setting file, extension/websitestatistics/settings/bcwebsitestatistics.ini.append.php

    Examples of possible settings override file location

    settings/bcwebsitestatistics.ini(.append(.php))
    settings/override/bcwebsitestatistics.ini(.append(.php))
    settings/siteaccess/example_com/bcwebsitestatistics.ini(.append(.php))

4.2 Required Settings Modifications

4.2.1 Urchin

       First you will want to replace the default tracking code number.

       Default: Urchin=UA-994200-0
       Modification: Urchin=YOUR-Account-Number
       Example: Urchin=UA-999042-0

4.2.2 ShopName (Optional)

       If you wish to use the e-commerce order statistics features of google analytics
       you would replace the string, 'mycustomshopname' with brief string to represent your shopname uniquely.

       Default: ShopName=eZ
       Modification: ShopName=YourShopName
       Example: ShopName=mycustomshopname 


4.3 Install BC Website Statistics Template Operators
    
    Decide first if you only need page tracking or if you also need webshop order tracking. 

4.4 Add Page Tracking Template Operator
   
    Install the following template operator code snippet in your primary design extension's pagelayout.tpl template:

    {'false'|bc_ga_urchin()}

    As the last element before the string '</head>'.

    ** Be certain to specify your Urchin website profile account code number in the extension settings.

    For more details on the BC Website Statistics template operator installation steps please see the file doc/USAGE.

4.4.1 Review
   
      Test. Test to ensure you installation has successfully enabled the related modifications (dependencies)

      Clear All Caches. Be certain to clear all caches via cli and admin.
       - eZ Publish Administration > Setup > Cache >> Clear All
       - eZ Publish Shell Command, # ./bin/shell/clearcache --clear-all

      Review. Review the source code output to ensure the page and order tracking features are enabled correctly.

      Reconfirm. Reconfirm the correct and successful installation of the settings and template operators.

      Enable. Enable Google Page Statistics Tracking

      You must confirm the installation of google analytics urchin information 
      into your eZ publish installation successfully within the Google Analytics 
      website after step #8, http://www.google.com/analytics

      Analytics Settings > Profile Settings > Tracking Status


4.5 Usage: (e-Commerce) Order / Purchase Statistics Tracking for your web site.
   
4.5.1 Enable Extension

    Simply enable this extension in your eZ Publish installation.

4.5.2 Configure Extension Settings

4.5.3 Install BC Website Statistics Template Operators

4.5.3.1 Install the following template operators in your primary design extension's templates.

    'bc_ga_urchin'
    
    For more details on the BC Website Statistics template operator installation steps please see the file doc/USAGE.

4.5.3.2 Install the following template operators in your primary design extension's pagelayout.tpl template

    'bc_ga_urchin'

    - bc_ga_urchin - Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchin()}' as the last element before the string '</head>'.

4.5.3.3 Install the following template operator in your primary design extension's order.tpl template

    - 'bc_ga_urchinOrder' - This template (a modified copy of the confirmorder.tpl) is enabled by default by the google analytics design extension and activated by default.

    Please note the following important installation dependencies surrounding the customization of the order.tpl template

    - The bcwebsitestatistics extension provides one unique template.

    - The template 'google/analytics/order.tpl' is based on the ezwebin (3.9.0) design extension template 'shop/confirmorder.tpl'

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been modified to (upon workflow event trigger) present the user with an 'order completed' view before presenting the user with the 'order view' / 'order receipt view'.

    - The template 'order.tpl' has been simplified to ensure it's unique and distinct from the 'order receipt view'.

    - To install the operator 'bc_ga_urchinOrder', Place the template operator '{'false'|bc_ga_urchinOrder( $order )}' in your own replacement for the template order.tpl

4.5.4 Create Workflow

    A) In the eZ publish admin, go to Setup -> Workflows
       and click New Workflow Group.

    B) Name the group something like "Shop" and click OK.
       The group will be added to the workflow groups.

       Workflows box click the "New Workflow" button.

       1) Name the workflow "Receipt".

       2) You will now see an Event select dropdown.
          1) Select "Event / BC Website Statistics - Google Analytics - Order Statistics Submission and Order Completed View"

          2) Confirm you choice by clicking the "Add Event" button
             just to the right of the select dropdown.

       3) Enter a description "BC Website Statistics Receipt Workflow Event Template View"

       4) Click the 'Ok' to save these modifications.

       5) Clear All Cache via both the administration gui and cli script.
          Please, clear all cache completely, this the most important step most people omit.

       6) Note: Do not edit workflow setting, must remove and read to affect workflow event definitions as they are stored in a very static prone to confusion if you try to edit instead of remove and re-add.

4.5.5 Install workflow to trigger

    A) Now click on the Triggers link in the left hand menu.

       In the table "Workflow Triggers" you will see a list of available triggers.

       On the line: "shop, checkout, after, (Workflow Drop Down)"

       "Click" the dropdown select the receipt event you have just created.

       Click Apply changes Button to save your trigger selection modifications

    B) Clear All Cache via both the administration gui and cli script.

    C) After you have followed all these steps, the extension's
       workflow settings should be activated, configured and functioning properly.
